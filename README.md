Detection of fake news using SimHash algorithm provided by google

“Fake news” was not a term many people used four years ago,but nowadays it is arguably one of the most serious challenges facing the news and media industry today. Fake news is written and published usually with the intent to mislead in order to damage an agency, entity, or person, and/or gain financially or politically advantages,[3][4][5] often using sensationalist, dishonest, or outright fabricated headlines to increase readership. Similarly, clickbait stories and headlines earn advertising revenue from this activity.[3] Fake news undermines serious media coverage and makes it more difficult for journalists to cover significant news stories.[6]
