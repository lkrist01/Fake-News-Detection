Regards - Philippe Hamel, 12/17/2018 Just purchased my site from HugeDomains! To everyone who's even a little hesitant on purchasing through them; despite any negativity you're going to see in their comments and reviews, this was a super easy, quick and professional service. I was emailed my secure information immediately after purchasing and given access to my domain within 24 business hours. No scams, or weird gimmicks. 10/10 would purchase through these guys again! To anyone wondering about why there are so many angry reviews: it's literally just because they LEGALLY buy and then upsell domains. It's actually a really smart business model and people do that stuff all the time with concert/game tickets (Stubhub.com) and other sites like eBay. You can buy things at any antique stores and then upsell them to make a profit. Anyone saying that these guys are criminals or scam artists are straight up just butthurt that they had to buy a more expensive domain. It's that simple. - Nicole Rodrigues, 12/13/2018\n\nJust purchased my site from HugeDomains!
