Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn for four to eight years.\u201d\n\nClimate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades.\n\nAl Gore\u2019s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 \u2013 a year that was touted as being \u201cthe hottest ever\u201d in the Earth\u2019s history \u2013 there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.\n\nDebunking the \u201c97 percent\u201d lie\n\nOn top of those \u201cinconvenient truths,\u201d the White House\u2019s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the \u201c97 percent\u201d statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.\n\nMore objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe.\n\nFrom the National Review:\n\n\u201cA 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.\u201d\n\nOther mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda \u2013 even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being promulgated by global warming proponents.\n\nAnd, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well.\n\nMany of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth \u2013 not human activity.\n\nAl Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoax\n\nBut the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you\u2019re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 \u2013 largely due to investments in fake \u201cgreen tech\u201d companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.\n\nYou might want to take all of this
