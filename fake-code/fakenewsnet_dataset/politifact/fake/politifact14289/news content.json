This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program.\n\nAustralia is getting its citizens microchipped\n\nShanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. \"You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, \"Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of \u2018convenience.'\n\nBut while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.\n\nThis means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen\u2019s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "http://cdn.disclose.tv/sites/default/files/styles/teaser/public/img/post/2012/07/24/americans-to-receive-a-microchip-implant-in-1013-per-obamacare-85636.jpg?itok=GC6OxxEc", "http://cdn.disclose.tv/sites/default/files/styles/teaser/public/img/post/2016/06/22/the-us-government-plans-to-begin-microchipping-children-132388.jpg?itok=vbQrxR2E", "http://cdn.disclose.tv/sites/default/files/styles/teaser/public/img/post/2017/08/05/leaked-docs-confirm-you-might-already-be-microchipped-139930.jpg?itok=KyhWuE8I", "http://cdn.disclose.tv/themes/custom/disclosetv/assets/flags/4x3/us.svg", "http://cdn.disclose.tv/themes/custom/disclosetv/assets/badges/heart-o.svg", "http://cdn.disclose.tv/themes/custom/disclosetv/assets/logo-min.png", "http://cdn.disclose.tv/sites/default/files/styles/teaser/public/img/post/2016/12/14/house-passes-bill-allowing-americans-to-be-implanted-and-tracked-via-microchips-136987.jpg?itok=DtKjuNBW", "http://cdn.disclose.tv/sites/default/files/styles/teaser/public/img/post/2016/08/27/australia-becomes-first-country-to-begin-rfid-microchipping-its-citizens-like-cattle-134656.jpg?itok=J2QJBdqw", "http://cdn.disclose.tv/themes/custom/disclosetv/assets/badges/star.svg", "http://cdn.disclose.tv/sites/default/files/styles/teaser/public/img/post/2015/03/25/nbc-news-all-americans-will-receive-a-microchip-implant-in-2017-115801.jpg?itok=rv77FFXG", "https://cdn.disclose.tv/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/img/post/2017/01/20/australia-becomes-first-country-to-begin-microchipping-its-public-your-body-no-longer-belongs-to-you-137503.jpg?itok=NHJKlsF8", "http://cdn.disclose.tv/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/img/post/2017/01/20/australia-becomes-first-country-to-begin-microchipping-its-public-your-body-no-longer-belongs-to-you-137503.jpg?itok=xmVTqcZN", "http://cdn.disclose.tv/sites/default/files/styles/avatar_small/public/img/user/2017/12/10/vailham.jpg?itok=VBUNYNgV"], "top_img": "https://cdn.disclose.tv/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/img/post/2017/01/20/australia-becomes-first-country-to-begin-microchipping-its-public-your-body-no-longer-belongs-to-you-137503.jpg?itok=NHJKlsF8", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.disclose.tv/australia-becomes-first-country-to-begin-microchipping-its-citizens-313155", "title": "Australia Becomes First Country To Begin Microchipping Its Citizens", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 119130391441497, "pages": 211482380627}, "theme-color": "#000000", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "rights": "Copyright \u00a92019 Disclose.tv.
