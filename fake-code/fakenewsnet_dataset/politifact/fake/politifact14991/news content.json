Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was \u201cbuilt by immigrants.\u201d\n\nFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not \u201cimmigrants\u201d but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/anthonySmollett11-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/Rosello-328-Thumbnail-200x150.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/GettyImages-175158773-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/06/wi/afp/10/1l54p2i-e1498184306630-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/Theresa-May-5-200x150.png", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/donald-trump-twitter-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/illegal-aliens-arrested-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/12/wi/ap/30/1tki470-200x144.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/rashida-tlaib-barack-obama-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/GettyImages-168550861-e1461246192905-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/Theresa-May-4-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/wi/afp/28/93984a_china-vice-premier-liu-he-is-meeting-treasury-secretary-steven-mnuchin-e1553862890735-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/migrant_caravan-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/09/obama-netanyahu-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/2019-01-30-Swanton-Rescue-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/GettyImages-513157188-e1553870873737-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/RahmEmanuelblame1-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/Quigley-114-Thumbnail-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/GettyImages-134585946-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/04/Ismail-Haniyeh-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rep.
